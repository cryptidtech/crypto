## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the projects, please let us know. 

We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation will patch it within a reasonable amount of time

and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

The easiest way to report a security bug is to email a description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version) to 

[security at cryptid.tech](mailto:security@cryptid.tech).
